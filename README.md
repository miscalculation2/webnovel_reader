# webnovel_reader
*A very poorly written script to have your own HTML reader for webnovels*

Ever visited a website with horrible font or weird colours when reading webnovels? Ever had the urge to just correct the worst parts of that horrible machine-translated text but too lazy to actually do it? Well then don't look here because this is just a shoddy attempt from an amateur with little to no knowledge of coding, HTML, and Javascript. In any case, the goal is to create a webnovel reader that can be used to:
* read stuff locally on one's own computer (I'm not even going to try to touch mobile)
* do some minor editing work (who knows, maybe that MTL'er will appreciate someone revising their work)

## How it should work
You copy all words from a chapter, throw it raw into the program, and it is supposed to output a simple and local HTML file that you can read on your own computer.
To be honest, I'm sure there's some program that does what I want to do but better, but I haven't found it yet.

## Features that it should have some day
* Basic tools to change font size, font colour, background colour, text font
* Some automatic index to seamlessly switch from one HTML file to the next for a better reading experience
* A way to save one's reading preferences
* A way to save your changes to the text
* Some basic way to create rules (e.g. you notice that the MTL always translates a character's name wrong and you want to automatically perform search and replace)
* (Batch HTML file creation of novels through some fancy webscraping)
